Develop an application that demonstrates the uses and complexities of algorithms and data structures
by using diagrams, measurements, and a mobile interface. This application could be used for
interview preparation, test prep, and a learning source for computer science principles.

Core Technologies to be used:
* Animated gifs
* Timers
* User input
* Swipeable views
* Side-by-side visualizations for algorithm comparisons

Milestones:
1. Design “algorithm swapper” - Strategy pattern
2. Design user input model
3. First, numerical input
4. Design the algorithms!
